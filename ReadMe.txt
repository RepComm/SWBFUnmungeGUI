The gui has several extending features:
-Drag And Drop (lvl files, and exe tool itself, when it cannot be found automatically)
-"Batch" converting (just add multiple files)
-Commandline input sent directly to GUI
-Command windows (should) be silent
-Multiple files can be in different directories entirely

Features not implemented yet: //I just made this today, so expect updates.
-File chooser (just drag and drop right now)
-Duplicate file checking
-Extended error printing for the user

How to use:
You can double click the jar file itself, or run this command: 
java -jar "SWBFUnmungeUI.jar"
